Function(s) graphic(s) plotter.

Via "Graphic" module you can do the following.

 - Build function graphic(s) on coordinate plane and without plane, defined by table or by formula;
 - Build histogram.

For function(s), defined by formula (not by table of values or by keyboard input):
 - press keys from 0 to 9 to delete graphic from plane, which number is from 1 to 10.
 - press key "c" to delete all graphics from plane.
 - press arrow left/right to move graphic(s) left/right
 - press arrow down/up to move graphic(s) left/right
 - press w key to increase scale (zoom in twice)
 - press s key to decrease scale (unzoom twice)

Known issue: when you try to move graphic or zoom/unzoom and press appropriate button firstly, press it again. When you press firstly, axes are written and drawn wrongly.
